clothing：The model wears a sleek, high-neck black long-sleeve top paired with tailored black wide-leg trousers and black leather ankle boots. This minimalist and sophisticated base allows the intricate butterfly-embroidered blazer to be the undisputed focal point, ensuring a high-end and harmonious aesthetic.

background：A muted, textured, warm grey-brown wall with subtle plaster or concrete-like imperfections. The texture should be visible but not distracting, providing an understated yet rich backdrop that complements the earthy tone of the blazer and makes the colorful butterfly embroidery pop, enhancing the product's premium feel.

model_pose ：The model stands confidently, facing slightly to the left of the camera (about 3/4 turn), with her left hand casually slipped into the blazer's pocket or resting gently on her hip. Her right arm is slightly bent, allowing the blazer to hang naturally and showcasing the embroidery on the front and side. Her head is turned slightly towards the camera with a soft, engaging, and sophisticated expression. One leg is slightly bent or forward to create a subtle dynamic.

Camera Position: Eye-level, full-body shot of the model.

Composition：The model is positioned slightly off-center, adhering to the rule of thirds, to create visual balance and interest. There is adequate negative space around the model to highlight the product and the textured background without feeling cramped. The blazer is fully visible and the primary subject.

Camera Setting：Aperture: f/8-f/11 for sharp detail throughout the blazer and model. Shutter Speed: 1/160s. ISO: 100. Lens: 85mm prime lens for a flattering perspective. Lighting: Soft, diffused key light positioned slightly off-axis to the front-right, with a subtle fill light on the left to minimize harsh shadows and a very subtle rim light to separate the model from the background. Custom white balance for accurate color rendition.
