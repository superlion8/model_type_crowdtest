clothing： The model wears the navy blue short-sleeved polka dot dress. Paired with clean white minimalist canvas sneakers. No visible accessories other than small silver stud earrings. Her long red curly hair is styled naturally, flowing loosely around her shoulders. Makeup is fresh, natural, and dewy with a soft, natural lip color.

background： A seamless light greige (grey-beige) paper backdrop, evenly lit to create a soft, uniform, and clean appearance. The subtle warmth of the greige provides a sophisticated neutral tone that complements the model's complexion and hair, while making the navy dress pop without harsh contrast.

Her front leg is gently bent, and her foot is relaxed or slightly pointed. Her left arm is casually bent at the elbow, with her hand resting gently on her hip, showcasing the dress's waistline and drape. Her right arm hangs naturally by her side. Her head is slightly tilted towards the camera, and she has a soft, confident, and inviting expression, looking directly or slightly past the lens. This pose highlights the dress's silhouette, details, and comfortable fit.
