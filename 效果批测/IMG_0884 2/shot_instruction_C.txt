The model stands tall and confident, with her weight subtly shifted to one leg. One hand is casually slipped into the pocket of the wide-leg pants, while the other arm hangs naturally by her side, slightly bent at the elbow. One foot is placed slightly forward, allowing the wide leg of the pants to drape elegantly and showcase their full cut and material. Her gaze is soft and engaging, directed slightly off-camera, conveying a relaxed yet refined demeanor.
