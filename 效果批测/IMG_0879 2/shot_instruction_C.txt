clothing：A fitted, fine-ribbed crew-neck knit top in off-white. A relaxed-fit, single-breasted blazer in light beige, casually draped over the shoulders. Black pointed-toe ankle boots. A slim black leather belt if the top is tucked in. Small gold hoop earrings.

background：A seamless, light warm grey studio backdrop, clean and uncluttered.

model_pose ：Model stands with weight primarily on her left leg, the right leg slightly bent at the knee and extended slightly forward, allowing the wide-leg jeans to drape naturally and showcase their volume. Torso is gently turned three-quarters towards the camera, head facing directly forward with a confident, relaxed expression. Left arm is relaxed by her side, right hand casually resting in the front pocket of the jeans, subtly highlighting the waistline and the jeans' fit.

Camera Position: Eye-level with the model's waist, positioned approximately 8-10 feet away from the model, directly centered.

Composition：Full body shot, portrait orientation. The model is centered in the frame, with adequate negative space above her head and below her feet. Ensure the entire outfit, from the blazer to the boots, is clearly visible, with particular emphasis on the full length and silhouette of the wide-leg jeans.

Camera Setting：Aperture f/9, ISO 100, Shutter Speed 1/160s. White Balance set to Custom/Daylight. Lens 85mm prime. Soft, even studio lighting from a large octabox slightly to the left, with a fill light on the right to gently lift shadows.
