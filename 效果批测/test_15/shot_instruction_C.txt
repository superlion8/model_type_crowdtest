clothing: The light grey knitted long-sleeve polo shirt (worn as the main garment), charcoal grey tailored wide-leg trousers, and black minimalist leather loafers.
background: A seamless light grey concrete-textured wall, clean and uncluttered.
model_pose: Model standing, facing slightly off-center (e.g., 3/4 turn to the left), with one hand casually tucked into the front pocket of the trousers, and the other arm relaxed by their side. A soft, confident gaze directed slightly below the camera lens. The posture should be relaxed but upright, showcasing the drape and fit of the polo shirt.
Camera Position: Eye-level with the model, positioned directly in front of the model.
Composition: Full body shot, with the model centered. Ample negative space around the model, ensuring the entire outfit from head to toe is visible, with focus on the polo shirt.
Camera Setting: Aperture: f/9. Shutter Speed: 1/160s. ISO: 100. White Balance: Custom (set to studio strobes). Lighting: Soft, diffused key light from slightly above and to the left, with a larger fill light from the right, ensuring even illumination and minimal harsh shadows on the garment and background.
