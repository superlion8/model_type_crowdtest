Model wears a fitted black fine-knit crew neck top, paired with high-waisted, tailored black trousers. The black bomber jacket (the product) is worn over this outfit, partially unzipped to reveal the top underneath. Footwear: Sleek black leather ankle boots with a subtle heel. Accessories: Minimalist silver hoop earrings.

background：
Seamless light greige (warm grey) paper background, evenly lit to create a clean, sophisticated, and minimalist aesthetic. The background should be smooth and free of any visible textures or props.

model_pose ：
The model stands confidently with a slight weight shift to one leg, body turned about 3/4 towards the camera. One hand is casually slipped into a jacket pocket, and the other arm is relaxed at her side, subtly holding the partially unzipped jacket open. Her gaze is direct and self-assured, with a natural, calm expression.

Camera Position:
Full-body shot, positioned slightly below the model's eye level, approximately 8-10 feet away.
