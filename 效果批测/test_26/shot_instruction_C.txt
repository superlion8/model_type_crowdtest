clothing： The light blue striped long-sleeve shirt (product) is paired with high-waisted, wide-leg tailored trousers in a charcoal grey. The model wears minimalist black leather loafers. Hair is styled in a sleek low ponytail, and accessories are kept minimal, such as small silver stud earrings.

background： A seamless, light grey studio backdrop, subtly lit to create a soft gradient, providing a clean and sophisticated environment.

model_pose ： Model stands in a relaxed yet confident full-body pose, slightly angled to a 3/4 view. One hand is casually tucked into the trouser pocket, while the other arm is relaxed by her side. Her head is gently turned towards the camera with a calm, neutral expression, allowing the shirt's details and fit to be clearly showcased.

Camera Position: Eye-level, full-body shot of the model.

Composition： Model is centered in the frame with ample negative space around her, ensuring the focus remains entirely on the outfit and the product shirt. The frame allows for a slight crop above the head and below the feet to maintain a balanced, clean aesthetic.

Camera Setting： ISO 100, f/9, 1/160s. Lighting consists of a large main softbox positioned slightly to the model's left, and a softer fill light on the right, creating even, flattering illumination with subtle shadows to add depth.
