background: Seamless, matte light greige (gray-beige) paper background, clean and uniformly lit to create a soft, even tone without harsh shadows.

model_pose: Model stands relaxed with a slight weight shift to her left leg. Her right hand is casually tucked into the pocket of her trousers, while her left hand is gently resting by her side, allowing the hoodie to drape naturally. She looks slightly off-camera to her right with a soft, confident expression.

Camera Position: Eye-level to slightly below eye-level (approx. 1.5 meters / 5 feet from the ground), capturing the full body from head to toe.
