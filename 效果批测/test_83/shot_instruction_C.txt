clothing：The model wears the black velvet cropped hoodie with pink rhinestone lettering as the main item. Paired with mid-rise, black straight-leg denim jeans with a clean, slightly faded wash for a modern, edgy base. For footwear, black chunky combat boots to complement the urban-chic aesthetic.
background：A seamless, dark charcoal grey studio background with a subtle, soft gradient, transitioning from darker at the top to slightly lighter towards the bottom. This provides a sophisticated and moody backdrop that highlights the black velvet and pink accents without distraction.
model_pose ：The model stands with a confident, relaxed posture, body slightly angled to the left, with her left shoulder subtly forward. Her right hand is casually slipped into the hoodie's front pocket (if applicable, otherwise resting gently on her hip), and her left arm is slightly bent and relaxed at her side. She looks directly into the camera with a cool, engaging gaze. This pose showcases the cropped fit of the hoodie, the velvet texture, and the rhinestone logo clearly.
Camera Position: Eye-level, positioned approximately 8-10 feet from the model, directly in front.
Composition：Full-body shot, vertically oriented. The model is centered in the frame, occupying roughly 75-80% of the frame height, leaving balanced negative space above her head and below her feet. The focus is sharp on the model and the entire outfit.
Camera Setting：Lens: 85mm prime lens. Aperture: f/9. ISO: 100. Shutter Speed: 1/160s. White Balance: Custom (set to studio strobes, e.g., 5500K). Lighting: A large softbox as key light positioned slightly off-axis to the front-right, a fill light on the opposite side, and a subtle hair light from behind-left to add separation and highlight the velvet texture.
