model_pose: Model stands with a confident, relaxed posture, body slightly angled to the camera's left (viewer's right) to showcase the side embellishment on the pants. One foot is placed slightly forward and outward, creating a gentle curve in the fabric and highlighting the drape of the velvet. Arms are relaxed, with one hand casually tucked into the blazer pocket and the other arm naturally by the side. Head is turned towards the camera with a direct, composed gaze.

Camera Position: Full-body shot, camera at model's eye level, positioned directly in front of the model.
