clothing:
Model wears a sleek, fitted black turtleneck top under the coat, paired with tailored black slim-fit trousers. For footwear, black leather ankle boots with a subtle heel. Minimal accessories: perhaps small, delicate gold stud earrings to complement the coat's luxurious feel without competing.

background:
A seamless, warm, muted taupe or greige color paper backdrop, providing a sophisticated, clean, and understated canvas that allows the vibrant colors and texture of the tweed coat to stand out without distraction.

Model stands in a confident, elegant posture, angled slightly (approximately 3/4 view) towards the camera. One hand is casually slipped into a coat pocket, while the other arm hangs naturally by her side, slightly bent at the elbow. Her head is held high, with a subtle, serene expression, looking directly into the lens. This pose showcases the coat's full length, silhouette, and intricate details.
